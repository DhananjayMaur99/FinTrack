1. When user logs in the data - {
    "user": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Test User",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "created_at": "2025-11-04T11:56:11.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-11-04T11:56:11.000000Z",
        "deleted_at": null
    },
    "token": "3|Ifx1DtAlxfzvpFHdwev6aNHbh5himPCWQQaR7JuN361c5b66"
}

do we need every part of the data mentioned above it should give only User loggged in successfully and its token.


2. when a any model is deleted it return only 204 No content - It should also give a message that it is deleted.
